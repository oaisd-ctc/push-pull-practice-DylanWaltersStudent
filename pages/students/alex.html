        <h1>hi i'm alex</h1>
        <a href="dylan.html">actually can i see dylan's page his is probably better</a><br/>
        <a href="../../index.html">get me out of here i want to go back</a>

    <p>this is a cat...   it is very cute right?</p>
    <h3>wrong</h3>
    <p>this cat has <strong>malicious intent</strong> and wants you to <strong>suffer for all eternity</strong><br/>
    his beady little gaze only serves to <strong>distract you from impending annihilation at his hands</strong></p>

    <p>that's not all</p>
    <div class="image-glare img">
    <img src="../../images/animals/cats.jpg" alt="there are more of them good golly gee how terrifying">
    </div>
    <p>he is merely <strong>one of many</strong></p>


    <p>they function as a hivemind<br/>
    how do they do their malicious deeds?</p>

    <p>first they use their <strong>decieving appearance</strong> to convince you they are not a threat<br/>
    then they integrate themselves into your household<br/>
    lastly they commit <strong>tax fraud</strong> and bring you financial woe</p>

    <p>these animals have mastered <strong>psychological manipulation</strong> and will not stop any time soon</p>
    <p>their unparalleled skill and elegance of methods makes them my favorite animals</p>
